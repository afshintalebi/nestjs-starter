# NestJS boilerplate starter

A NestJS starter repository is like a ready-made template for starting a new Node.js project with the NestJS framework. It's a pre-configured codebase that includes essential files, folders, and configurations to accelerate the development process. This repository typically comes with best practices already in place, making it easier for developers to set up a robust and scalable server-side application. It often includes features such as user authentication, database integration, and pre-defined API endpoints, allowing developers to focus on building their application's unique functionality instead of spending time on initial setup.
